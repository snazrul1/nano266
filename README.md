# Introduction

This is the public repository for UCSD's NANO266 - Quantum Mechanical Modeling
of Materials and Nanostructures taught by Prof Shyue Ping Ong. The purpose of
this repo is to serve as a persistent and evolving collection of course
materials, including supplementary notes, lab homeworks, codes used, etc.

While this repo is completely open and anyone is welcome to use the materials
contain therein, I would ask that you acknowledge any usage.

# Multimarkdown

Many of the writeups (for labs, etc.) are done using multimarkdown. Github will
pretty much render most of the documents properly. Where necessary, PDFs are
also generated for you to download and view.

# Viewing the Notebooks

You can explore some of the supplementary notebooks using the excellent online
ipython notebook viewer. To begin, go to this
[link](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/materialsvirtuallab/nano266/tree/master/)
which points to the root directory.

# Acknowledgments

Some of the materials are inspired by and adapted from excellent MIT Course
3.320: Atomistic Computer Modeling of Materials taught by Professors Gerbrand 
Ceder and Nicola Marzari. Those materials are available on MIT Open Courseware.
